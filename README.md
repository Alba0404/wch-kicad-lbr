# WCH Kicad Library

This is not a official library and thus not all parts are included. You are welcome to open a PR to add support for new Parts.

The library tries to follow the Kicad Library Convention as close as possible, though full compliance is not guaranteed.

You can read the the Library Convention here: <https://klc.kicad.org/>

The Library is created using the latest Stable Version which is currently Version 6, this makes the Library not compatible with the older versions of Kicad.
